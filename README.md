# Contra

Contra is a type registry to map .NET types to anything. Types can be registered against values, and the values can be looked up by type.
Type resolution honours contravariance, so values registered against interfaces, base classes, etc. resolve correctly. Even structures like
Envelope<Message> work as expected.
